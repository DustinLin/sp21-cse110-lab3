                <h1>Dawn of the Final Day (4/7/2021)</h1>
                <h3>Here are some things I accomplished</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Caught up with lecture recordings in 151B</li>
                    <li>Attended a workshop (via UCSD's Writing Hub) and worked on my SOP</li>
                    <li>Started working on the 110 Lab!</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Notable things that happened</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The last chapter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan"><i>Attack On Titan</i></a> came out today (after over 10 years), and was unsatisfied with the ending of the story.</li>
                    <li>Took a nap in the afternoon, and actually woke up energizied (for once).</li>
                </ul>
                <details>
                    <summary>Why did I dislike the ending?</summary>
                    <p>There were lots of plot points that were resolved abruptly without explination, and outcomes that go agaisnt previous themes emphasized throughout the story. More plotholes were introduced (along with plot holes from previous points that weren't resovlved). A lot of hyped-up reveals were dropped.</p>
                </details>
                <p>Here is a nice little animation I found from a film I enjoyed as a kid (and still do).</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Source:</summary>
                    <p>Credits go to <span style="color: red">SeerLight</span>. I found this video from<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ImaginarySliceOfLife/comments/iw0vde/town_with_an_ocean_view_seerlight/">this post on r/ImaginarySliceOfLife</a> </p>
                </details>
                <br>
                <p class="centeredText">This is the most lengthly entry becuase its the day I most remember what happened.</p>
                <p> Since this is the only entry written in the present, I look foward to all the lectures tommrow, and to Professor Powell's memes in the evening. PS: Hopefully the moon doesn't come down tommrow</p>

                <h1>Dawn of the Second Day (4/6/2021)</h1>
                <h3>Here are some things I accomplished</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Finished a PA! The stress is relieved...</li>
                    <li>Started an assignment 2 weeks before its due. (<b>Start Early, Start Often</b>)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Leaks for the last <i>Attack on Titan</i> started coming out (pictures, text, summary), but I am holding out strong and not reading them. I hope the ending is good.</p>
                <p>Spent some time on my journey to 100% complete the video game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuphead"><i>Cuphead</i></a> 
                <br>
                <p>Here is a synthwave track that a friend of mine made today, thanks <strong>@Kevin Zhou</strong>!</p>
